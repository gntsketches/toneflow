- Test with save & load
  - make a page with the old build to see what they were supposed to sound like...
  - some scenes on desktop saved with 'synth' rather than 'monosynth'

  - (ok...) loadQwertySettingOnSceneChange might cause a bug
  - (ok...) will track.instrumentType crash compositions established without it? (not if I did it right...)
  - (ok...) test qwerty updates with updatePlayerStuff()

  Easier:
    - Make track-all-rests shortcut
      - all tracks all rests...
    - double each note
      - on all tracks
      - also option to spread all tracks

  More Involved:
    - function to clear all sounds. option on scene change & shortcut shift - minus!)
    - option to apply portamento only when multiple keys are pressed
      - why does the non-app version do that by default?!
      - can you pass in ' ' or 0 to synth to clear the last note?
    - new algorithm for rest notes - so that a track with low pitch% always changes _something_
    - record options: mp3 & MIDI export (& soundcloud upload...)
    - one mouse click on note brings editing cursor - if you click a qwerty it'll change to that note...
    - change note curvature on mouse double click (for better mobile use)
      - will require a rebuild of GlobalControls - to incorporate dropdowns
    - change size of info box... https://www.npmjs.com/pac/vue-draggable-resizable
    - option to make all first notes the same in drift modulation
    - move playing indexes forward/backward with arrows... which shortcuts? (a bit tricky, because you want to do this without invoking changes)
    - (is this needed?) more nuanced auto-adjusting of various settings for synth vs. sample
    - copy & paste: Vue-Drag-Select,   https://github.com/JSmith01/vue-selectable

  Misc:
    - option button to click in notes to a track from Qwerty
      - would need space & delete buttons too
    - shortcut to extend range up or down an octave (ctrl shift up arrow ctrl shift down arrow)... or perhaps it widens/narrows it in both directions?
    - track edit arrow keys repeat ok (will need to be keypress)
    - option to use spacebar like a pedal?
    - shortcut ('toggle') to apply various settings to all track notes for note shape (square, curved, circle)... all square, all curved, all circle, all circle but first curved, random,
    - delays: if/else for synch to tempo '8n' vs value in seconds?
    - https://vuejsexamples.com/vue-js-right-click-menu/

    - Scene stuff:
      - don't allow two scenes to have the same name, changes to one will affect the other
      - Copy scene (ctrl alt c)
      - new scene inherits tempo from previous scene?

    // are these doable in keypress? (without registering each number value as a separate handler? ie: can keypress accept an arbitrary number?
      - toggle all tracks to changePer 0 & back (change on/off)  (to change max / to change _x_)
      - all tracks for rest percent settings
      - sequence combo for modulation per: ctrl M #
      - shortcuts to choose specific mode

    - dangers of capslock! Disable?




    *** CHANGE QUEUE ***
      - maybe changesQueued goes over on the info section? (particularly if it happens on lead change and not on modulation)
      - doesnt affect: volume; does affect: mute, note change, new section (or remember)

  >>> MAYBE <<<
    The thing to do is actually have a fixed number of tracks/instruments, and scene change just changes the settings and content of the tracks...



  PRO FEEDBACK
    - initializeSceneAudio
    - is initializeSceneAudio the culprit? doesnt seem like it, with use of shortcut to do that...

  FORUMS / ASK
    - What is the best way to wire delays?
      - because when delay time is at 0, it is *doubling* the volume...!
    - what is the best way to wire gains?
      - equalize / divide gains




  CONSIDERING:


  https://superuser.com/questions/408570/how-can-i-tell-when-the-last-time-chrome-updated

    - Tone is a dependency in package.json ... could this be interfering with loading the script directly... ?

    - is DOM complexity a factor? (per desalasworks...) This might explain why the app seems like it used to have better performance but it has been gradually declining.
        - how do I find out if DOM complexity is a factor?
            - a factor in what? synth distortion? flanges?

    Multiple Threads, multiple cores - how can I use more cores? Maybe I have "resource contention/exhaustion". Can I make parts of this asynchronous?
      - Can this be split between multiple cores?
      - whats the relationsip between browser and core use? multi-threading for javascript.
      - music program javascript multiple cores
        - multiple threaded approaches to music applications...

    Analyze loops in this context...
        "Profiling" - breaking down and benchmarking how long is each part of the app taking...
            - profiling library

    Why does it sound ok until you add one more?

    Whats the difference between CPU, memory, disk

    - substantial distortion if you just push a 8-note track into the second place!
      - I betcha you ar not disposing of the synth when you do that, just creating a new one...!
        - kinda looks like it, because in setUpNewTrack you are splicing a track before doing initializeSceneAudio (which does the dispose)
          - but is the synth actually involved in that? or just the track which provides the info about how to play it?

    - multitrack/multiscene:
        - crackling & timing-performance breakdown when number of tracks/scenes begins to rise...
          - seems to be the case whether the tracks are all on one scene or multiple (the total number of tracks is the problem. It can handle four. Five starts to break down, 6 is unplayable.)
        - use .dispose()?
        - You probably need to read this: https://padenot.github.io/web-audio-perf/

        - let vs var performance?

    TRANSMISSION & SCENE CHANGING

    - Maybe: only do mod & form if there is a mod or form (default to something else otherwise)
    - Hmmm: advance per Change or Modulation - doesnt do change or modulation, just advances.
        - tried adding conditionals in for these in checkAdvanceCueVsChangeIncrement and it just confused things!
        - I think it's fine without them. The scene resets on change anyway - so form will reset, and you'll be adding an option to remember or return to a section anyway.
    - note how advanceAndPlayTrack changes non-lead tracks in an else - might result in some of those changes being skipped

******************************************************************************************************
* DESIGN & UI HMMM
********************************************************************************************************/
{

    UI HMMM:

      - ? grey out vs. remove not-needed items? (eg: player decay & sustain for sample)

      - Button for changeAll?

      - apparently a rest note can 'change' to a rest note. (rest note is outside prev-note test loop)
        - got some basic code in there to fix that, commented out
        - it seems it would be good if that didn't happen because then you can have nothing happen on a change sometimes
        - but if it doesn't this is also problematic "musically", because then if you have high changeTotal and low note% values, it ends up filling and then empytying it every cycle... ie: the fill is not a correct reflection of the change number

      - fill track automatically sets change to 1... on purpose?
      - some way to indicate that a button (eg: 'remember' has been pressed), like a flash or something
      - Filter range vs filter selectedNotes ?
      - Mute track option works, but with a click...
      - use of shift-w/e when scenes are chained?
      - Do you want "Reset" to reset the form? (resetScene mutation)
          - If so, does formStep go to -1 or 0?
      - Use of 'Distribute' with form - if form section is prefixed, distribute overwrites first note with prefix (so its not an accurate distribution). Would be cooler if it didnt.
          - ALSO if could be cool to have an option where it distributes the whole mode each time it modulates.
      - Is the note randomization algorithm good (specifically with reagrd to how rests are handled?)

      - dragging scenes leaves current editingSceneNumber (so it changes the scene...) do you want that different?
          - check out addNewScene...         state.editingSceneId = newScene.id

      ShortCuts & Playbility:
      - seems like, stay away from just 'ctrl-' shortcuts, because those are common?
      - MAYBE the 'playing' shortcuts have just shift-, and 'composing' shortcuts have ctrl-shift- or a seqeunce combo?
          - so FILL and DISTRIBUTE become ctrl-shift- ? (except I use them alot...)

      - (advance meter for til-change on each track? ... not until you understand the performance cost)

			- what if modulation or form increment is selected and there is none?
				- It doesn't advance. I guess that's fine. It's disruptive to have it default or switch to Lead Cycle/Change - the user might want to toggle autoModulate or form/drift on/off for compositional reasons.


    DESIGN HMMM:
      - better highlighting for focussed elements
      - entry tone: use ableton-esq headphones icon?
      - conditionally bind titles? https://www.reddit.com/r/vuejs/comments/8960ze/conditional_attributes_titles/?st=jhxk7a9m&sh=371ba71c

* REFACTORING / BUGS / MORE HMMMMMMM
******************************************************************************************************/
BUGGIN {


  - super weird thing that sceneAdvanceProgress (in SceneInfo) doesn't register for leadTrack.toneTuneIndex === 1 ! (so blue bar jumps from 0 to '2')


  - when changing playerWaveType: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'dispose' of undefined at t.Gain.dispose (Tone.min.js:8) at t.Volume.dispose (Tone.min.js:9) at t.Oscillator.t.Source.dispose (Tone.min.js:9) at t.Oscillator.dispose (Tone.min.js:10) at Object.<anonymous> (Tone.min.js:12) at t.Context._timeoutLoop (Tone.min.js:7) at t.Context.t.Emitter.emit (Tone.min.js:7)
    - still appears to be changing waveType ok tho
    - also, probably related: player fatOscillators - when adjusting count, where is 'length' involved here?: "Error in callback for watcher "storePlayerCount": "TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null" BUT THIS DOESNT HAPPEN ON THE TRACKS!
    - length error preceed by "Error in callback for watcher "storePlayerCount": "TypeError: Cannot read property 'dispose' of undefined"
    - both track and player are receiving a number...


  - release on track samples seems shorter at higher values...
    - 'duration' vs 'release', hmm. maybe experiment with triggerAttack vs triggerAttackRelease?
    - note that there's the same thing where when release seems to be having an inverse effect
    - weird! gtrSwell is echoing on player... echo seems to happen when release is set near 3.

  - what is this thing where you hear the first note of new scene and last note of previous scene at the same time.
      - its due to release setting, so last note of previous scene is still playing.
      - so you could rig up a way to cancel out any hanging pitches on scene change?

  - why is track entry pitch so much louder than playerQWERTY?


  - hmmm, when switching player to monoSynth (weirdness with error "cannot read property 'dispose' of undefined"... but it works fine...)

  - Gradus - on load up: cannnot read property dispose of undefined...
      - In Gradus, when adding a new scene, it has blanks in new modulations... doesnt happen for more recently created compositions and is ok on load...
      - when shift-} ing, was putting rests in first soft-square note

  - TRACK CONTROLS check out how CSS color of track controls and width of inputs is smaller when app is loaded up with default soundpanel off... (soundpanel divs are not present until the panel is there, they must be affecting display)

  - Text Entry
    - scenes to save with lower-case "s"
    - cant use caps in scene rename or in harmonic form entry
    - cant input spaces in scene rename

  - after changing the selectedNotes in an element of the form, it returns to those same elements when it comes through the form again (eg: in Gradus, removed some chromatic elements, and they where gone next time I scrolled through form)

  - keyboard use of html-dropdowns with *enter* are getting stuck and entering track again...
      betcha its because of "activeRegion" : if (this.activeRegion==='' && e.key==='Enter') { this.down = [] } // this prevents 'Enter' from getting stuck in down when a select is focussed. It works but feeling a bit suspicious. (Or perhaps more conditions are needed here?)

  - double OR bar (||) in buildHarmonicForm regex...?

  - looks like, if you change an element (mode) in the form once youre into the form, it doesnt change the actual pitch set until the next time around... ? (or maybe its just for the next mode up?)
      - I think its just for the next mode up, because thats already been established (as it moves through the form calls the next formStep)
          - maybe not even worth fixing? since you cant edit the form while its playing anyway.
      - today it just jumped past that section of the form, weird. (It was the last section.)It highlighted it for half a second first then went back to the first part.


  - (works) anyway though): Invalid prop: type check failed for prop "value". Expected Number, got String. found in ---> <KnobControl> at src\components\KnobControl.vue <TrackSoundPanel>

  - (Oops, deleted 'giant step'!) Watch for this bug: 'giant step' doesnt fill first note on lead track for a#\d#dia

  - param entry
      - https://forum.vuejs.org/t/use-of-keyup-with-select-elements/50928/4
      - hmmm. tab/shift-tab highlights QWERTY  when tabbing through select options
          - review the whole active-region thing... some bugs there...
          - HTML "select" items (will? do?) now have changeFunction (?), using bus...
              - is anything actually using the bus to call clearKeyFromDown? yet at least in TuneChanger it does so...
      - validate...
        - if you enter or leave a field after spacebar, it stays blank. should resume previous (or at least defaults.)
        - shortcuts around trackControls sometimes will leave a field blank, and also


  - when track removed ...
      during play crashes it
      lead track number disappears. probs has to do with this.

  - changing scene NAME causes huge distortion and phase-out, seems to be overloading something...

  Fixed Already?
    - 4/10/18 This may be fixed, but Watch for it: Some bug when track added, maybe after deleting, where the tune doesn''t change when UI tune display changes
    // 7/24 ? Didn't do this: - Play crashes when upper and lower range are the same :^)   // Tone.min.js:9 Uncaught ReferenceError: trackIndex is not defined - at eval (store.js?c2d1:1005)
    - What happens if you input (rather than scroll) changeMax to a number higher than the actual changeable number? seems like it already has some kind of validation...
    - ctrl-up or down will place -1 or 10, but not change from it. fix with regex.
}

REFACTORING {

  - tidying: can you make new, more abstract method in store for changeTrackWave, changeTrackNoteDuration...

  - knob size - can you do that with a variable?

  - all those Knobs divs & associated computed could probably be more sensibly translated into a single type of component which you'd pass props... ?

  - betcha could eliminate those watchers on the App.js
      - by putting all the audio stuff on AM, and then call it from the store
      - somehow the playerObject needs to be actually located on the AM rather than just called from App tho.

  - import helper.js rather than load

  - is there any problem with enterFunction being called on both blur & keyup/change? (you can see this best by watching the logs when entering from an input field like playerAttack)

  - General cleanup
      - store actions and mutation classifications
      - "mute" is an option on synths and you dont need to the pre-post mute volume selectors. (but check if you need it for samples before you change things...)
      - seems like you are not DRY about changing the value of fill length... maybe you can use a watcher to update it based on the length of the lead track (rather than changing the value in the functionality of the various places you update the length)

  - Keyboard entry & shortcuts - organize & refactor, keypress compatability
      - register and unregister combos by region (per reddit)  //https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/8l9h2j/use_of_keypress_library_with_conditional_input/?st=jhi4stc9&sh=44da25e6
      - Ctrl-R plays pitch...

  - 'BIG' FUNCTIONS to reduce
      - morphSelectedNotes
      - buildHarmonicForm
      - changeTune
      - advanceTrackStep
      - onkeydown


  - rather than making '_' a note/pitch, would it make more sense to append it in render?

  - examine activeRegion and previousRegion, enter commands vs shortcuts... how do you want to do this? Note difference in focusFunction (to use previousRegion or not)

  - activeRegion: maybe the focusFunction and enterFunction could be referenced from somewhere else to standardize them?

  - Changing Scenes:
    - I *think* with the current logic the scene chain will only override a user change select if its the last leadCycle
    - highlight or tag lead track ... YES can do but gotta think about the track control component structure...

  - Component Structure
    - Pull RangeAdjust and TuneChanger up into TrackControls? (easier maniuplation of methods, etc...)
    - Pull ChangeTrackWave up into TrackSoundPanel? (especially as you develop alternate sound panels...)
    - Harmonic Form display should be its own component.
      - BUT, consider that other functionality may be added later (for example, fixed-tunes to go along with harmonic form.)
      - So it might be best to wait and see how it all settles out since you dont yet know how everything will be added/removed/changed.


  - changePreviousRegion & changeActiveRegion: it's now possible to tab around through these & go back to the proper region on change/enter/blur...
    - it seems to do this by placing (say) qwerty-player back in state.activeRegion on blur and then placing it back in to state.previousRegion as if focuses the next input
    - so that works, but there might be unknown bugs, or a more elegant/airtight solution like perhaps state.previousRegion only recognizes the 'big 3' (piano-selector, tune-entry, qwerty-player) regions

    - use of: mapState, mapGetters, mapMutations... https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/state.html#the-mapstate-helper
      https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuex-pathify ( see https://www.reddit.com/r/vuejs/comments/8t53lw/specify_object_value_with_vuex_vmodel/?st=jirsykxc&sh=866c915f)
      https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/368922/architectural-problem-in-use-of-tonejs-with-vuex/372924#372924


  MODULATION STUFF
    Tightening things up:
    - check for presence or absence of '-' in mode naming conventions (internally)
        - yeah you are using that to split the root vs type in the pickMode function
    - is there a difference between MODE and MODULATION? When are you using these?
      - also modulationType is more specific than "modulation" ... switch to using that when that's what you're doing
    - re DRIFT, turning off autoModulate does not reset change counter to 0. (? Do you want that ?)
      - I think this is the same thing: when you do some progress towards a modulation, then change PER to 0 then back to 1, the blue bar is still at the same value


  VUEX
    - Modules:
        - read that article first. maybe modularize by function type?
        - there was a reddit post about this...
    - track editing?
    - autoModulate vs toggleAutoModulate
        - seemed like there was some good reason autoModulate accepted on/off rather than a toggle. What was it? Currently toggleAutoModulate is for the keyboard shortcut:

            heres a post, possibly relevant: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tonejs/7fuL_8_SlIo


  NAMES TO CHANGE:
    - 'Morph' too Power Rangers...
        - can do this fast with WEBSTORM...?
    - 'modulationCycles' : this is easy to confuse with formStep...

  CODE HMMM:
    - In main.js: "Vue.directive('focus', { ...etc. " ... is this in use?
    - "Uncaught SyntaxError: Tone.TimeBase: Unexpected end of expression at t.TimeBase._parsePrimary "
    - maxChangeable: if a track is at maximum & a note.random is switched from 'fixed', the changeNumber will increase with it. kind of a nice feature actually, but did I code this deliberately?
    - changing tempo from changeScene mutation (to be action?) feels a little hackey. or like I might forget its there...?
    - distribute... currently ignores length...
    - There was some (Vue) duplicated-thing-please-use-keys error. Do I need more Vue keys?
    - Be wary of Hot-Recompile... see Tone.Transport.clear...  (seems that the Tone functions are out of Vue scope!)
      - may need to brush up on lifecycle methods...


    - track-lock feature? comment from advanceTrackStep: // if (this track's lock# is itself) { behave normally } // else { use the toneTuneIndex of the lock# and ignore values above or below }

REFACTOR-ED FYI {

  - rebuilt tracks so that no track is 'entering' - add new tracks with enter or button
      - (yes) rename "entered tracks" to just "tracks"... might be able to remove a cointaining div...
      - (yes) clean out CSS for old entering track
      - (yes) track number display and lead track change option both start at 0, confusing for non-programmer users! (yes) check that all instances using new leadTrackNumber computed property are still functioning properly
      - (yes) add track pushes on an endcap, fix that
      - (yes) Highlight active track rather than whole tracks section
      - (yes) removing tracks (not the lead track!) - try from all the positions... if (scene.editingTrackNumber === removeTrackNumber )  and it's track 0...?
      - (yes) button for add track
      - (yes) leadTrack remains first track unless otherwise specified
      - (yes) push newtrack 'below' rather than joggle them around to push old track down

  - changeTrackWave removed - the component provides and example of getting and setting without using v-model. in 'historical'

  Literate Programming (an example per Delip):
    use a nested object structure to inlude the "shortcut descriptions" on the actual code for the shortcuts themselves in dispatchTables,
    then call that info from the the help file (rather than coding it separately)

  Delips noun verb exercise:
    Take a piece of paper and put nouns on one side and verbs on another side.
    Once you got em, take a different sheet and organize into bullet headings
    Then take another sheet and diagram how the nouns are related to each other
      Ie: how are certain types of functionality the same between different nouns  - this is a guide to DRY which helps remove unneeded complexity.

  JSLint - will automatially simplify some expressions for you

  Code Coverage tool (maybe in IDE), shows you which parts of the code you are not using

  ? Making all these conditionals more readable: establsh all boolean values at the beginning of the function
      then the conditional logic reads more like a sentence

  SOUNDS
      - drone track

  - "Automated" parameters ...
    - eg: variation on LFO, Harmonicity, etc.
    - some function that would pick targets and then ramp to them (setInterval? webAudioAPI methods like setTargetAtTime? )
      - settings for fluctuations would be chosen by user (which params, depth range, frequency range)
      - building a demo that does just this would be fun. maybe a good dronebox.
    - along with this, could also have a 'randomization' feature for a track's params

  - new-scene autofill
    - for jamming, to get something new and unexpected to work with
    - Fill new scene with two new random tracks - should cover "fix track" memory options for mode morph
      and desire to have something brand new happen. (new scene tempo matches current scene tempo)
        - you made functions for this... which ones?? are they still there?
        - using a helper to fill tracks, hmmm.
        - cant make much progress on this until you figure out the issues with Tone's scenes

  - lengthen and shorten note duration of each note with shift-arrows
      - use gradient to show note stretch behind other notes
      - will it accept, say, 3 8n ? or how does that work?

  - group sets of notes on a track and have them change in tandem (to same new pitch, or by same step/skip/leap within the key)
    - ?the UI on this?

  - edit scene without changing/playing it (previous scene still plays in the background)

  - "grab bag" or "repertoire" list of tunes (in common across all compositions?)
      wherein you can add items to the bag, and it will pull them out for you at random
      also can be done manually or auto
      -? modulatable? or otherwise adaptable to the current settings?
      eventually, "teachable" through Tensorflow or some AI library

  - MOUSE OPTIONS: (could be fun to adjust track with mouse while paying QWERTY; also could make it more useable in mobile)...
      - Tracks: how to get all the possibilities in there? click to focus, double click to empty or fill, wheel to select notes, context menu for other stuff...

  - LOAD can be very slow! need a spinny wheel, or to figure out better performance...

  - and of course VERTICAL CHORD EDITING, which might just be a different app (since it seems so mouse/drag heavy...)

  Less-needed or not-yet-useable shortcuts:
    - double/halve tempo(?) (makes more sense with a changeQueue )
    - Jump to scene (maybe mouse is fine? also same number value question. also app cant handle many scenes yet - is it a desired feature?)
    - (enter) to copy track (maybe once performance is awesome...)
    - used to have a leadSelect shortcut (on "L"!), which you removed.
    - adjust fill number

  - SCENE SECTIONS
    // not doing this, I think. this is really what scenes are for. also the complexity (esp the regex, but including the UI) for this is beyond the point of fun anyway
    - reset scene should reset to 'remembered' or sec1
    - dont use numbers, use strings as names...? (hard to regex?)
    - shift-1-9 jumps to section

  - MOBILE
